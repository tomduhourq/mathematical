#mathematical

The project arose as an intention to help my brothers study physics and math with less effort, by providing them with:

- Simple operations on Vectors in R2 and R3
- Simple extensions for numeric classes
- Complex numbers with operations

using Scala with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck, under construction.

At the time being, we can only use it through Scala's REPL.
